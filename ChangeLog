	* Test.php: Style patch from Ricardo SIGNES <rjbs@cpan.org>:
	Replace got/expected with the standard have/want terminology. Also
	supresses diagnostic output when both have and want are null. That
	means that ok(0, "whatever") will no longer tell you what you have
	and want, since it didn't know anyway.
	* Makefile.PL: Ran dos2unix on the Makefile.PL to use unix newlines
